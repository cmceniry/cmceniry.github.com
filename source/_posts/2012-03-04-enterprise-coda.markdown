I know I'm looking for confirmation bias here, but I think [Seth
Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/03/why-lie.html)
does actually apply to my interactions with arrogant vendors.

    ...when we clearly articulate why we're not going to do business, the
    salesperson responds by questioning the judgment of the prospect.

    ...

    Someone who chooses not to buy from you isn't stupid. They're not
    unable to process ideas logically, nor are they unethical or
    manipulated by others. No, it's simpler than that:

    Given what they know and what they believe, the prospect is making
    exactly the right decision.

    We always make our decision based on what we know and
    believe. That's a tautology, based on the definition... a decision
    is the path you take based on what you know and believe, right?

    The challenge, then, it seems to me, is to realize that perhaps
    the prospect knows something you don't, or, just as likely,
    doesn't believe what you believe. Your job as a marketer is to
    figure out what your prospect's biases and worldview and fears and
    beliefs are, and as a salesperson, your job is to help them know
    what you know.

To Vendors: Rather than belittling what isn't yours, how about you
talk about facts? I'm not an idiot who you can smokescreen, so don't
waste our time doing that.
