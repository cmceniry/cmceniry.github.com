I was at a tech conference this week, and talking with some people. Most of them were former San Diego people who are now SF or Austin. It came up that SD is lacking in the size of its computer tech community. Sure there's a lot of good stuff in Biotech, but if you look at the number of computer start ups, we don't have the same feel as LA or NY (I'm not even including SF as it's a different category). There's 17 meet ups in just the next week for "Tech," and 110 groups in the area. Is it enough? I'm not sure as I can't say how active they are, but 17 seems like a low number for meetings. So, I think there is some truth to SD not being in the same league, but I think it's also something we can change.

Though it's nice to be a big fish, even if it's a small pond, one of the better was to improve is to surround yourself with people who will bring you up. There's some adage about not being the biggest fish in the pond.

Personally - leaving SD isn't a huge option for me, and I'm still iffy on telecommuting. So, I'm left with making SD a better place. "Left with" is probably the wrong word choice with a negative connotation. Reality is that it's just the place that I am right now. So, all of those behoove me to make SD a better place for this.

So, "Why is SD like this?" Part of me wants to avoid that question completely, but you can't really address a problem unless you identify it. So, here's my reasons:

.) Location - The county is spread out a bit, so it's hard to build momentum when you can't even build it in one place
.) Support - Most of the big supports are companies and, currently, those support what SD is known for: Biotech and Military.
.) Topics/discussion - "There's few people will to lead a discussion." This is self-fulfilling crap. Momentum builds but you gotta get it going first.
.) Ganas - There's a concern that the culture here just isn't as go-getting as SF or other places. That seems to put is into a Fixed Mindset rather than a Growth Mindset. But Mindsets can change.

What can we do for each of these? In the groups that I'm working with (largely, LOPSA-SD and the SD Cassandra User Meetups):

Location: I think this is a matter of being a bit flexible (stealing this from some comments on [SF Perl Mongers](http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2014/07/15/san-francisco-perl-mongers-12-months-50-growth/) - interesting to see them talking about how to address not being as involved as they'd like. To that, I'm gonna start by making it a bit optional. I think getting some video recordings or live streaming going is step 1. Beyond that, probably playing with the actual location or timing will help us find the right fit. I think long term, it's best to have some stability, but in the short term, we probably have to experiment a bit to see what the community wants.

Support: I know that some company support has been coming. It's time to extend this into reaching out to other groups and see what we can do to support each other. Maybe offering some goods and services, or location, or joint meetings. I'm not sure, but this is an area to take a look at. Reaching out will be fun, since I know I'm an [Introvert](http://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2013-10-14).

Topics/Discussion: This one is kinda making me scratch my head. There's so much out there. I think the key is to just take some topics and run with them.

Ganas: I really do think that there's enough people in SD who want to be out there, exploring and learning new things. The key here will be convincing others that they are interested, and addressing what's in it for them. Still some work to sort out here.

Yeah - those second two are fairly lacking for concretes, so I'll have to come back to those at a later point.

Fundamentally, I think it's about creating a learning community (a la learning organizations). I want people to feel safe and encouraged to explore and improve. Yeah, it helps me, but in the end it also is the right thing to do.
