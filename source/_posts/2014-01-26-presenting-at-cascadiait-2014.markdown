Hey Kids! Big News!

I'll be presenting at [CascadiaIT 2014](http://casitconf.org/casitconf14/)! I've got two items:

* [A Quick Introduction to System Tools Programming with Go](http://casitconf.org/casitconf14/conference/tutorial-descriptions/) Tutorial
* [Value Stream Mapping Your Workflows for Fun and Profit](http://casitconf.org/casitconf14/talk-descriptions/) Talk

Registration is now open:

So, if you're anywhere near the Seattle area the second weekend in March, come on down to CascadiaIT!
