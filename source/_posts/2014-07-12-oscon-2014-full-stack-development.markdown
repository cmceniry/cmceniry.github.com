In other news, I'm giving a tutorial on the Go language at OSCON. This
is a big one for me so hoping it goes well.

As part of the lead up to it, they sent a call out to the speakers
asking us to comment on "full-stack development." This was supposed to
be submitted as a video, but I didn't get to it in time. It was open
ended, so not sure if it was supposed to be meaning or impact. So,
here’s some quick thoughts on it.

Fundamentally, being able to address the full stack is about
autonomy. Much has been done to show that people a driven by having
feelings of autonomy, mastery, and purpose (see Daniel Pink). The idea
is that if we feel like we are able to own the work, we are more
motivated to complete it. I think we can all think of personal
projects which we’ve been caught up in and put in the extra effort on
them. Part (yeah, only part) of what drives us is that we get to set
the terms of the project - how it's conceived, how it's developed, and
how it’s delivered.

In many organizations, much of this work has been given to specialized
functional units so it's harder to have ownership in those sections.
Thinking about he full stack let's us insert ourselves into those
parts of the project. Basically, being a full stack developer gives
you more changes to get that autonomy back.
