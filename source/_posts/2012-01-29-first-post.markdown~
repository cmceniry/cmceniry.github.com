Just a test of the first post.

Got [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) up and running. I like the idea of a staticly deployed blog using a simple mark up language. I lose comments, but part of me thinks that having a blog is a minimum for participating in the discussion. It's a bit much, but I'll wait to see if it becomes an issue and figure it out then.

To avoid the install issue wi

    gem 'rubypants'
    -gem 'rb-fsevent'
    +gem 'rb-fsevent', :git => 'git://github.com/ttilley/rb-fsevent.git', :branch => 'pre-compiled-gem-one-off'
    gem 'stringex'

Also getting some annoyance from markdown. Apparently nesting a block code inside a list doesn't work. That's why the above is done.
