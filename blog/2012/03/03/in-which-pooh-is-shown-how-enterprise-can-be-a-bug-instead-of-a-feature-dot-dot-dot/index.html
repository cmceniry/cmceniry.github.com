<div class="entry-content"><p>I was in a meeting the other day with a storage vendor selling their
wares. He asked what we had at the time, and I let him know, and was
extremely surprised by his response.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re using X,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s nice, but if you want an Enterprise solution, you
really need to be using ours,&#8221; he spouted off smuggly.</p>

<p>At which point, I had to say something. &#8220;It&#8217;s statements like that
that are why nobody likes [your company].&#8221;</p>

<p>My boss laughed, I think mostly to defuse it a bit, but he also said
&#8220;He&#8217;s not kidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I wasn&#8217;t. I really think that if you want to come into my house
and try to sell me something, the number one thing you do is not
insult me and what I currently have. At least, don&#8217;t try it until you
have an idea of how I feel about the solution. In this case, it wasn&#8217;t
that I was tied to it, but that that&#8217;s what we had, plain and simple.</p>

<p>The second thing that you may want to do is say something that
actually adds value, not just belittles the competition. Ok, so let&#8217;s
assume that Enterprise is a good thing - why is your solution more
Enterprise than what we have? In this case, he eventually added that
it was twice as fast as our current solution.</p>

<p>Which leads me to the third thing you may want to do. Don&#8217;t try to
sell on facts taken out of context. Ok, so it&#8217;s twice as fast. It&#8217;s
also 4 years newer technology. According to Moore&#8217;s Law applied to
storage, if you&#8217;re only twice as fast, you&#8217;re half or a quarter of
where you should be on the progression curve.</p>

<p>So, what does Enterprise mean? Based on the vendor comments, it&#8217;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better than what we have right now,</li>
<li>Just something we should trust the vendor on, and</li>
<li>Behind on the technology curve.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great sales job.</p>

<p>I think of the other &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; products that we have. Usually,
there&#8217;s one or more of the additional features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complex licensing model - $ per core up to this rate, and then $$ per
core past that, but only if you have X amount of RAM, or it was
purchased on a Blue Moon.</li>
<li>Manual installation - It requires a GUI to install, can&#8217;t be
automated (even with something like a response file), and sometimes
you have to do parallel steps and hope that they don&#8217;t have race
conditions or start over when they do.</li>
<li>Inflexible - &#8220;You can do other things with it, but that would be a
custom setup and unsupported.&#8221;</li>
<li>Long patch cycles - This would be fine if we all didn&#8217;t already know
that half of what&#8217;s out there is commodity open source software. It
doesn&#8217;t matter you&#8217;ve wrapped it all up under an appliance bow -
it&#8217;s still vulnerable to whatever it is that the patch is for.</li>
<li>Lots of fingerpointing when it doesn&#8217;t interact correctly in my
owner situation or with other Enterprise software.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, what is Enterprise software? It can&#8217;t be software that we&#8217;re
paying for the quality of. What it really comes down to - it&#8217;s
software that we can outsource the blame to&#8230; if we&#8217;re lucky.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t good Enterprise software out
there. Just means that what is good out there probably isn&#8217;t being
bought for the reasons that it&#8217;s being marketed for.</p>
