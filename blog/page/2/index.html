  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m starting a new project aimed at handling firewall policies in a
sane way. Well, it&#8217;s not so much the firewall policies themselves, as
it about how we think about the firewall policies, or more precisely,
about how we think about the application policies themselves.</p>

<p>All firewall configurations that I&#8217;ve been part of have come about in
a specific pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone writes an application, and puts together some documentation
that, if we&#8217;re lucky, includes a visio of how the application
talks. Most of the time, it&#8217;s something closer to a &#8220;open these ports
on your firewall to make this happen.&#8221;</li>
<li>A sysadmin/app engineer/gwmth(guy who makes things happen - some
future post) looks over the documentation and identifies specific
hosts (IPs really) based on where the app components are running. He
puts together a ticket asking for specific ports to be open for
specific IPs or ranges. If you&#8217;re lucky (I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;ve been that
lazy admin), the admin puts together a visio of how it is all laid
out.</li>
<li>A netadmin takes the rules from the sys/app admin, tries to match
them up to existing rules or network ranges and adds them to the
firewall. If it&#8217;s not a stateful device, it&#8217;s worse than that as
you&#8217;re limited by the language.</li>
</ol>


<p>So, we&#8217;ve got a little game of operator going on here. On top of that,
usually the only permanent records of the change show up in two
places: any ticketing system, and the firewall itself. This means that
to try to figure out what happened, you have to go sort through
tickets or reverse engineer it from the firewall itself.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever had to deal with this, you end up having to reverse
engineer it all the time.</p>

<p><strong>This doesn&#8217;t work.</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s now <a href="http://www.redsealnetworks.com/">tools</a> that will help
you with this, be more efficient at it. They look at all of the rules
and you can go back and check to see what&#8217;s approved for what. But the
modelling is still done on a &#8220;this IP has access via this port to this
other IP, and this collection of IPs/ports are this model.&#8221; But it&#8217;s
still approaching it the wrong way - and if you&#8217;re more efficient at
doing the wrong thing, you&#8217;re just doing it wronger.</p>

<p>These tools do other things, but from an application perspective,
they&#8217;re very late in the game. So, late that it feels like we&#8217;re doing
network management backwards. I think we gotta go back to the
beginning. Instead of focusing on the network and building rules from
there, I want to start with the application and derive the rules from
there.</p>

<p>And yes, before we go there, documentation is good. I&#8217;m not trying to
give people a pass on the documentation. I&#8217;m trying to find a way that
makes it easier to document. So, keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Imagine that when you write an application, you can also easily
identify what network communication is needed relative to the
components for you application. For example, look at a simple LAMP
application. It fundamentally, has 3 components:</p>

<ol>
<li>the Database,</li>
<li>the Web Server, and</li>
<li>the web site consumers.</li>
</ol>


<p>And we can readily identify what access is needed:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>Web Server</strong> needs access to the <strong>Database</strong> on port
<strong>3306</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Web site consumer</strong>s need access to the <strong>Web Server</strong> on port
<strong>80</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s fundamentally &#8220;X needs access to Y on port P&#8221; or if you want to
move it around &#8220;X is allowed on port P to Y&#8221; or &#8220;X is allowed P to Y.&#8221;
If you&#8217;ve done any access control before, you&#8217;ll notice the same
pattern of Actor(X), Resource(Y), and Permission(P).</p>

<p>I think there&#8217;s something about this that can be done
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language">SAML</a>,
but its focus is on the individual&#8217;s identity and access
control. Maybe there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m missing, but if I am, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=don't+understand+saml">I don&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m in the minority</a>.</p>

<p>So, we have a general form for recording the policy. There&#8217;s also the
other key take away from this one in that we&#8217;re not dealing with
IPs. Nowhere above is an IP listed. We&#8217;re talking about components
(Actors and Resources). This could take the form of:</p>

<pre><code>{'MyWebSiteModel':
  [
    'WebServer': 'DB:3306/tcp',
    'WebSiteUser': 'WebServer:80/tcp'
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is just the general description. It&#8217;s still not very useful. To
do that we have to instantiate it - basically, assign hosts/IPs to
each of the components:</p>

<pre><code>{'MyWebSiteInstance':
  'Model': 'MyWebSiteModel',
  'Components': {
    'DB': ['2.2.2.2'],
    'WebServer': ['1.1.1.1', 'web2.mydomain.com'],
    'WebSiteUser': ['0.0.0.0']
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Based on all of that information, you can form the rules that would be
needed to fit any firewall.</p>

<p>How does this address my initial problem? It comes down to fitting the
abstraction model to the handoff points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Application Developer: Generates the components and communication
patterns.</li>
<li>Application Administrator: Instantiates and assigns specific IPs or
hosts to each of the components.</li>
<li>Network Administrator: Gets a concise description to work from. If
the right amounnt of automation is applied, I might be marginalizing
the network admin for this task (that&#8217;s not completely true - there&#8217;s
plenty of sites that have enough device complexity that no simple
model will be immediately applicable - but it could still be used as a
starting point)..</li>
</ol>


<p>The model I used above is overtly simple. I already have questions
around RPCs, dynamic ranges, encapsulated protocols (* over http,
anyone?). I&#8217;m only starting the discussion here and dealing with the
minimal accomplishable step. It&#8217;s something to build on.</p>

<p>Now for the practical hand waving. The follow up pieces to this are
the tools to make it useful. We still need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A tool for recording this. This could be done via the above forms,
but it&#8217;d be nice to have it wrapped up in a bow. This is doubly
desired when we have to consider how all of the policies are
instantiated with the specific host information.</li>
<li>A tool for visualizing. It&#8217;d take in the general descriptions, and
show a pretty display for it.</li>
<li>A tool for converting the models to rules. It would take in the
general descriptions, the specific host information for each
instantiation, and then outputs some for iptables, pf, acls,
firewall policies, etc. Yeah, some magic here.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, first things being first, my <a href="http://github.com/cmceniry/ancl">next project</a>
is something for tracking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you sit on the Left or the Right, or the left or the right, or
the middle, or the Middle, or underneath it all or wherever, I would
really appreciate if the discourse that we had didn&#8217;t resolve to
namecalling based on ignorance. I know that that doesn&#8217;t help get
money<sup>Wsupport</sup> for elections, but it keeps me from adding to the
&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to live on this planet anymore&#8221; meme. If you don&#8217;t
understand how that&#8217;s connected, please read
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republic-Lost-Money-Corrupts-Congress/dp/0446576433">Lessig</a>.</p>

<p>So, it makes me feel good to see that
<a href="http://www.carbonite.com/en/blog/A-Message-from-Carbonite-CEO-David-Friend-Regarding-Ads-on-Limbaugh">Carbonite</a>,
not only pulled their support for Limbaugh, but also will not continue
even in light of Limbaugh&#8217;s apology. Given multiple hyperbolic
statements by Limbaugh in the past, I don&#8217;t feel any sincerity. On the
other hand, I feel that Friend is sincere:</p>

<pre><code>“No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke, and I have two,
could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this
courageous and well-intentioned young lady. Mr. Limbaugh, with his
highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable
bounds of decency. Even though Mr. Limbaugh has now issued an
apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising
from his show. We hope that our action, along with the other
advertisers who have already withdrawn their ads, will ultimately
contribute to a more civilized public discourse.”
</code></pre>

<p>But even if I assume it&#8217;s a marketing move, it&#8217;s a marketing move that
puts the discussion in the right direction.</p>

<p>Friend is putting his money where his mouth is; I think I have to do
so as well (even if I don&#8217;t have a completely good use case for it for
me).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I&#8217;m looking for confirmation bias here, but I think <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/03/why-lie.html">Seth
Godin</a>
does actually apply to my interactions with arrogant vendors.</p>

<pre><code>...when we clearly articulate why we're not going to do business, the
salesperson responds by questioning the judgment of the prospect.

...

Someone who chooses not to buy from you isn't stupid. They're not
unable to process ideas logically, nor are they unethical or
manipulated by others. No, it's simpler than that:

Given what they know and what they believe, the prospect is making
exactly the right decision.

We always make our decision based on what we know and
believe. That's a tautology, based on the definition... a decision
is the path you take based on what you know and believe, right?

The challenge, then, it seems to me, is to realize that perhaps
the prospect knows something you don't, or, just as likely,
doesn't believe what you believe. Your job as a marketer is to
figure out what your prospect's biases and worldview and fears and
beliefs are, and as a salesperson, your job is to help them know
what you know.
</code></pre>

<p>To Vendors: Rather than belittling what isn&#8217;t yours, how about you
talk about facts? I&#8217;m not an idiot who you can smokescreen, so don&#8217;t
waste our time doing that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in a meeting the other day with a storage vendor selling their
wares. He asked what we had at the time, and I let him know, and was
extremely surprised by his response.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re using X,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s nice, but if you want an Enterprise solution, you
really need to be using ours,&#8221; he spouted off smuggly.</p>

<p>At which point, I had to say something. &#8220;It&#8217;s statements like that
that are why nobody likes [your company].&#8221;</p>

<p>My boss laughed, I think mostly to defuse it a bit, but he also said
&#8220;He&#8217;s not kidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I wasn&#8217;t. I really think that if you want to come into my house
and try to sell me something, the number one thing you do is not
insult me and what I currently have. At least, don&#8217;t try it until you
have an idea of how I feel about the solution. In this case, it wasn&#8217;t
that I was tied to it, but that that&#8217;s what we had, plain and simple.</p>

<p>The second thing that you may want to do is say something that
actually adds value, not just belittles the competition. Ok, so let&#8217;s
assume that Enterprise is a good thing - why is your solution more
Enterprise than what we have? In this case, he eventually added that
it was twice as fast as our current solution.</p>

<p>Which leads me to the third thing you may want to do. Don&#8217;t try to
sell on facts taken out of context. Ok, so it&#8217;s twice as fast. It&#8217;s
also 4 years newer technology. According to Moore&#8217;s Law applied to
storage, if you&#8217;re only twice as fast, you&#8217;re half or a quarter of
where you should be on the progression curve.</p>

<p>So, what does Enterprise mean? Based on the vendor comments, it&#8217;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better than what we have right now,</li>
<li>Just something we should trust the vendor on, and</li>
<li>Behind on the technology curve.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great sales job.</p>

<p>I think of the other &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; products that we have. Usually,
there&#8217;s one or more of the additional features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complex licensing model - $ per core up to this rate, and then $$ per
core past that, but only if you have X amount of RAM, or it was
purchased on a Blue Moon.</li>
<li>Manual installation - It requires a GUI to install, can&#8217;t be
automated (even with something like a response file), and sometimes
you have to do parallel steps and hope that they don&#8217;t have race
conditions or start over when they do.</li>
<li>Inflexible - &#8220;You can do other things with it, but that would be a
custom setup and unsupported.&#8221;</li>
<li>Long patch cycles - This would be fine if we all didn&#8217;t already know
that half of what&#8217;s out there is commodity open source software. It
doesn&#8217;t matter you&#8217;ve wrapped it all up under an appliance bow -
it&#8217;s still vulnerable to whatever it is that the patch is for.</li>
<li>Lots of fingerpointing when it doesn&#8217;t interact correctly in my
owner situation or with other Enterprise software.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, what is Enterprise software? It can&#8217;t be software that we&#8217;re
paying for the quality of. What it really comes down to - it&#8217;s
software that we can outsource the blame to&#8230; if we&#8217;re lucky.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t good Enterprise software out
there. Just means that what is good out there probably isn&#8217;t being
bought for the reasons that it&#8217;s being marketed for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watched a video there other day. It&#8217;s making it&#8217;s rounds on the

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a></li>

<p>The key with it is to be mindful of what you&#8217;re doing when you start
to write something. Do something that matters - both from the
perspective of contributing to society, but also how it contributes to
society. Don&#8217;t just do something dumb that&#8217;s noble - make it awesome
and noble. At least, that&#8217;s what I got from it.</p>

<p>Those who care to put the finishing touches on something are the ones
who will do good things. Not necessarily the ones who will succeed or
excel (or appear to have excelled), but the ones who will have good
things to show.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while now, Chef has bothered me. Some of it I can blame on the
server setup (pull/push and exposure of general manifests), but
there&#8217;s been something that&#8217;s been bothering that I hadn&#8217;t been able
to put my finger on&#8230; until now.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;m going to come out and admit my bias to a declarative model
over an imperative model. I won&#8217;t go into why. Burgess does a much
better job <a href="http://cfengine.com/markburgess/blog_order.html">describing this</a>.</p>

<p>My issue with Chef comes down to one word: action.</p>

<pre><code>package "ntp" do
  action :install
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to be fair, this is a very declarative description. If you dig
into what it&#8217;s doing, you&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s interrogating the system
and only installing the package if it needs to, or alternatively,
it&#8217;ll make sure that the package exists. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s not
&#8220;install&#8221;ing every time, it&#8217;s making sure it&#8217;s
&#8220;install&#8221;ed. &#8220;Install&#8221;ing is a verb (it&#8217;s saying &#8220;action&#8221;), but
&#8220;Install&#8221;ed is a noun (state).</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Let&#8217;s go back to cfengine:</p>

<pre><code>commands:
  "yum install -y ntp"
    ifvarclass =&gt; "!ntp_installed"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re further down the slope. This is a command/verb/action -
there&#8217;s now way around that. We&#8217;ve detached the descriptive goal of
what we want from how we&#8217;ve written. We have to know that our
convention for an installed package is to use that command structure,
and to make sure there&#8217;s a class that checks for if ntp is installed
or not. The var is in the check, not in the overall description.</p>

<p>So, why is Puppet better?</p>

<pre><code>package { "ntp":
  ensure =&gt; present
}
</code></pre>

<p>There&#8217;s no confusion around this one. It&#8217;s clearly saying make sure
this package is present/installed. The magic of how that happens is in
the underlying resource abstraction layer, which is cool in and of
itself, but it&#8217;s real win is that it allows you to continue thinking
in a declarative way, not in an imperative way. There&#8217;s no mental
flipping back and forth.</p>

<p>Ok - so why does <em>that</em> matter?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Language matters</a>.
Language influences the way you conceptualize a problem, plain and
simple. The BDD guys hark on this as well. I think for sysadmining
roles to move forward, we need to think in a declarative way. Yes,
there are times for an imperative method, but not in system
descriptions.</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s a nitpik, but it&#8217;s one that can have far reaching impact.</p>

<p>And yes, I know you can do execs in Puppet, so you can shoot yourself
in the foot, but you&#8217;ll have less misfires with Puppet than with other
tools because of the way it makes you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> up and running. I like the idea
of a staticly deployed blog using a simple wiki-like mark up
language. I lose comments, but part of me thinks that having a blog is
a minimum for participating in the discussion. It&#8217;s a bit much, but
I&#8217;ll wait to see if it becomes an issue and figure it out then. For
now, I have a blog, so I&#8217;m going to focus on the writing.</p>

<p>Ran into a few issues setting up Octopress - somewhat my own
fault. The first was that I switched from rvm to rbenv. Wasn&#8217;t really
an issue, but rvm feels more ready for prime time on OSX Lion. I had
trouble getting ruby to build, and had to switch from LLVM to GCC. I
would think that it shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it seems to. I
<a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads">kennethretiz&#8217;s prebuilt packages</a>
to be the best install.</p>

<p>After that, got to the point where I do &#8216;bundle install&#8217; from the
Octopress clone, and it started complaining about not finding
&#8216;stdio.h&#8217; when building fsevent_watch. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/320">Others have seen this
before</a>, but really
the issue is being <a href="https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/20">addressed</a>
by the fsevent gem. Ends up being some fun differences between LLVM
and GCC again. I switched over to the prebuilt fsevent gem, and that
worked. Just a simple change in &#8216;Gemfile&#8217;:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'rubypants'
-gem 'rb-fsevent'
+gem 'rb-fsevent', :git =&gt; 'git://github.com/ttilley/rb-fsevent.git', :branch =&gt; 'pre-compiled-gem-one-off'
gem 'stringex'
</code></pre>

<p>Those are the main build issues, but also ran into a couple of issues
working with Octopress.</p>

<p>The first usage issue is that I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the
overall git workflow. You do a clone of the Octopress repo, and then
work within that clone. This seems a bit unclean to me. I want to keep
my actual blog source and the Octopress source separate, even if the
Octopress source is tracking. Add to that that I&#8217;m sending the site up
to Github&#8217;s personal pages for hosting it, so that has its own
repo. Just seems like this will bite me at some point.</p>

<p>The second issue is just getting familiar with markdown. I&#8217;m finding
out some of its limits, like how it can&#8217;t embed block quotes inside
numbered items. Nothing major, just learning myself.</p>

<p>But, Octopress is up and running, and posting to the Intarwebs, so
that has to be considered a success. Now I get to move on to the real
content.</p>
