    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Watched a video there other day. It's making it's rounds on the
internet. It's definitely worth watching:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The key with it is to be mindful of what you're doing when you start
to write something. Do something that matters - both from the
perspective of contributing to society, but also how it contributes to
society. Don't just do something dumb that's noble - make it awesome
and noble. At least, that's what I got from it.</p>

<p>Makes me think of this blog post as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/01/who-cares.html">Who Cares?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Those who care to put the finishing touches on something are the ones
who will do good things. Not necessarily the ones who will succeed or
excel (or appear to have excelled), but the ones who will have good
things to show.</p>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>
