  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watched a video there other day. It&#8217;s making it&#8217;s rounds on the
internet. It&#8217;s definitely worth watching:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The key with it is to be mindful of what you&#8217;re doing when you start
to write something. Do something that matters - both from the
perspective of contributing to society, but also how it contributes to
society. Don&#8217;t just do something dumb that&#8217;s noble - make it awesome
and noble. At least, that&#8217;s what I got from it.</p>

<p>Makes me think of this blog post as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/01/who-cares.html">Who Cares?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Those who care to put the finishing touches on something are the ones
who will do good things. Not necessarily the ones who will succeed or
excel (or appear to have excelled), but the ones who will have good
things to show.</p>

<p>Just food for thought.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a while now, Chef has bothered me. Some of it I can blame on the
server setup (pull/push and exposure of general manifests), but
there&#8217;s been something that&#8217;s been bothering that I hadn&#8217;t been able
to put my finger on&#8230; until now.</p>

<p>First, I&#8217;m going to come out and admit my bias to a declarative model
over an imperative model. I won&#8217;t go into why. Burgess does a much
better job <a href="http://cfengine.com/markburgess/blog_order.html">describing this</a>.</p>

<p>My issue with Chef comes down to one word: action.</p>

<pre><code>package "ntp" do
  action :install
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, to be fair, this is a very declarative description. If you dig
into what it&#8217;s doing, you&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s interrogating the system
and only installing the package if it needs to, or alternatively,
it&#8217;ll make sure that the package exists. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s not
&#8220;install&#8221;ing every time, it&#8217;s making sure it&#8217;s
&#8220;install&#8221;ed. &#8220;Install&#8221;ing is a verb (it&#8217;s saying &#8220;action&#8221;), but
&#8220;Install&#8221;ed is a noun (state).</p>

<p>Why does this matter? Let&#8217;s go back to cfengine:</p>

<pre><code>commands:
  "yum install -y ntp"
    ifvarclass =&gt; "!ntp_installed"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we&#8217;re further down the slope. This is a command/verb/action -
there&#8217;s now way around that. We&#8217;ve detached the descriptive goal of
what we want from how we&#8217;ve written. We have to know that our
convention for an installed package is to use that command structure,
and to make sure there&#8217;s a class that checks for if ntp is installed
or not. The var is in the check, not in the overall description.</p>

<p>So, why is Puppet better?</p>

<pre><code>package { "ntp":
  ensure =&gt; present
}
</code></pre>

<p>There&#8217;s no confusion around this one. It&#8217;s clearly saying make sure
this package is present/installed. The magic of how that happens is in
the underlying resource abstraction layer, which is cool in and of
itself, but it&#8217;s real win is that it allows you to continue thinking
in a declarative way, not in an imperative way. There&#8217;s no mental
flipping back and forth.</p>

<p>Ok - so why does <em>that</em> matter?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Language matters</a>.
Language influences the way you conceptualize a problem, plain and
simple. The BDD guys hark on this as well. I think for sysadmining
roles to move forward, we need to think in a declarative way. Yes,
there are times for an imperative method, but not in system
descriptions.</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s a nitpik, but it&#8217;s one that can have far reaching impact.</p>

<p>And yes, I know you can do execs in Puppet, so you can shoot yourself
in the foot, but you&#8217;ll have less misfires with Puppet than with other
tools because of the way it makes you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> up and running. I like the idea
of a staticly deployed blog using a simple wiki-like mark up
language. I lose comments, but part of me thinks that having a blog is
a minimum for participating in the discussion. It&#8217;s a bit much, but
I&#8217;ll wait to see if it becomes an issue and figure it out then. For
now, I have a blog, so I&#8217;m going to focus on the writing.</p>

<p>Ran into a few issues setting up Octopress - somewhat my own
fault. The first was that I switched from rvm to rbenv. Wasn&#8217;t really
an issue, but rvm feels more ready for prime time on OSX Lion. I had
trouble getting ruby to build, and had to switch from LLVM to GCC. I
would think that it shouldn&#8217;t matter, but it seems to. I
<a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads">kennethretiz&#8217;s prebuilt packages</a>
to be the best install.</p>

<p>After that, got to the point where I do &#8216;bundle install&#8217; from the
Octopress clone, and it started complaining about not finding
&#8216;stdio.h&#8217; when building fsevent_watch. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/320">Others have seen this
before</a>, but really
the issue is being <a href="https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent/issues/20">addressed</a>
by the fsevent gem. Ends up being some fun differences between LLVM
and GCC again. I switched over to the prebuilt fsevent gem, and that
worked. Just a simple change in &#8216;Gemfile&#8217;:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'rubypants'
-gem 'rb-fsevent'
+gem 'rb-fsevent', :git =&gt; 'git://github.com/ttilley/rb-fsevent.git', :branch =&gt; 'pre-compiled-gem-one-off'
gem 'stringex'
</code></pre>

<p>Those are the main build issues, but also ran into a couple of issues
working with Octopress.</p>

<p>The first usage issue is that I&#8217;m still trying to figure out the
overall git workflow. You do a clone of the Octopress repo, and then
work within that clone. This seems a bit unclean to me. I want to keep
my actual blog source and the Octopress source separate, even if the
Octopress source is tracking. Add to that that I&#8217;m sending the site up
to Github&#8217;s personal pages for hosting it, so that has its own
repo. Just seems like this will bite me at some point.</p>

<p>The second issue is just getting familiar with markdown. I&#8217;m finding
out some of its limits, like how it can&#8217;t embed block quotes inside
numbered items. Nothing major, just learning myself.</p>

<p>But, Octopress is up and running, and posting to the Intarwebs, so
that has to be considered a success. Now I get to move on to the real
content.</p>
